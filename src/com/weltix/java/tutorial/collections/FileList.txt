Aggregate operations do not contain a method
like next to instruct them to process the next
element of the collection. With internal delegation,
your application determines what collection it iterates,
but the JDK determines how to iterate the collection.
With external iteration, your application determines
both what collection it iterates and how it iterates it.
However, external iteration can only iterate over the
elements of a collection sequentially. Internal iteration
does not have this limitation. It can more easily take
advantage of parallel computing, which involves dividing
a problem into subproblems, solving those problems simultaneously,
and then combining the results of the solutions to the subproblems.
See the section Parallelism for more information.
